## Cardano

### Setting up Cardano node

> using docker 
>
> ```
> docker image pull inputoutput/cardano-node
> docker volume create cardano-node-data
> docker volume create cardano-node-ipc
> ```
>
> git repo is saved at 
>
> ```c
> c:/code/docker/cardano
> ```

### Generate Key

The `cardano-cli` is installed in the as part of the installation process. This Cli provide a collection of tools for generating keys, constructing transactions, creating certificates, and other important tasks.

It is organized in a hierarchy of subcommands, and each level comes with its own build in documentation of command syntax and options. For more details [Cli Command line](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node/blob/master/doc/reference/cardano-node-cli-reference.md/])

##  

> Cli to generate keys 
>
> ```
>    cardano-cli node key-gen \
>         --cold-verification-key-file cold.vkey \
>         --cold-signing-key-file cold.skey \
>         --operational-certificate-issue-counter-file cold.counter
